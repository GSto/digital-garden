# All plain text everything

I am moving as much of my data to plain text formats as possible.

## plain text is evergreen

If you want your data to work on a computer in 2060, you need to keep it in a format compatible with 1960. Plain text has survived decades of technological change and will continue to do so. This longevity makes it the most reliable format for long-term data preservation.

## embraces the unix philosophy

Text can be the output of one program and the input of another. Keeping things in plain text gives you optionality and utility. Plain text works on and integrates with everything: every device, most programs, most systems. This interoperability is the foundation of composable, flexible workflows.

## plain text is more LLM-friendly

The more you want to work with LLMs, the more you are going to want your data in plain text. Language models process text natively, making plain text the most efficient format for AI-assisted workflows.

## Obsidian is a killer app

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) gives you power on top of plain text without sacrificing portability. You can version control it, sync it across multiple devices, add graphs with Excalidraw, create queries and visualizations with dataview, manage tasks, and use AI support through smart compose plugins.

## interoperability principle

If something can't be plain text, it should be able to easily input and output plain text. Google Drive can export to Markdown. Excel can export to CSV. These formats are acceptable compromises. The key is avoiding vendor lock-in to proprietary information management systems.
