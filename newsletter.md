Back in 2022, Everything was in flux. COVID was winding down. Interest rates were going back up. ChatGPT was released. I got a new job. I beacme a father.

These days, I’m writing about that stuff, along with System is As System Does: a book designed to help software engineers sharpen their product skills and think more holistically.
