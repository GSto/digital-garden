## Hi, I'm Glenn Stovall
I’m a software engineer turned engineering manager. I’ve been writing & building online for 15 years.

I believe there’s no greater joy in life than putting all of yourself into building products that help others. To that end, I’ve been working on a [book on product thinking for engineers](https://www.statetransition.co/p/why-im-writing-a-book-for-engineers).

I think you should embody a spirit of play in everything you do. [Play is serious business](https://www.statetransition.co/p/play-is-serious-business).

I practice East Coast kindness over West Coast niceness.

I act knowing there is no need to rush and no time to waste.

Lately, I’m exploring how we can leverage LLMs in writing and coding, getting the best of the advantages without the slop. 

I love to help people [stop overthinking](https://www.statetransition.co/p/my-leeroy-jenkins-year), figure out what we want, and get out of our own way. 

In 2022 I started a blog exploring the navigating changing states of the world. Here are some my best posts:

- [Financial independence as philosophical suicide](https://www.statetransition.co/p/financial-independence-as-philosophical) — The FIRE movement’s focus on frugality and early retirement can be a way to avoid asking what really matters to you. I dig into ways you can find fulfillment and exercise agency in your finances and work.
- [How to Improve your product intuition](https://www.statetransition.co/p/how-to-improve-your-product-intuition) - A sample chapter from *System is As System Does*. Learn how to build stronger product instincts through heuristics, pattern matching, and practice.
- [The Uncertainty Tailspin](https://www.statetransition.co/p/the-uncertainty-tailspin) - Uncertainty triggers a threat response, but if we learn to manage it, we can use it to discover new opportunities.
