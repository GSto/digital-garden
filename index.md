# Hi, I'm Glenn Stovall
I’m an engineer recently turned engineering manager. I’ve been writing & building online for nearly 15 years.

I believe there’s no greater joy in life than putting all of yourself into building products that help others. To that end, I’ve been working on a [book on product thinking for engineers](https://www.statetransition.co/p/why-im-writing-a-book-for-engineers).

I believe one way to do this is to embody a spirit of play in everything you do. [Play is serious business](https://www.statetransition.co/p/play-is-serious-business).

Lately I’ve been curious about how AI can be leveraged for writing to enhance human creativity instead of drowning it in slop. (Protip: don’t ask it to be creative for you.)

In 2022 I started a blog exploring the navigating changing states of the world. Here are some my best posts:

- [Financial independence as philosophical suicide](https://www.statetransition.co/p/financial-independence-as-philosophical) — The FIRE movement’s focus on frugality and early retirement can be a way to avoid asking what really matters to you. I dig into ways you can find fulfillment and exercise agency in your finances and work.
- [How to Improve your product intuition](https://www.statetransition.co/p/how-to-improve-your-product-intuition) - A sample chapter from *System is As System Does*. Learn how to build stronger product instincts through heuristics, pattern matching, and practice.
- [The Uncertainty Tailspin](https://www.statetransition.co/p/the-uncertainty-tailspin) - Uncertainty triggers a threat response, but if we learn to manage it, we can use it to discover new opportunities.
