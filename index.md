# Public Notebook

This is a [[digital garden]] of content that isn't quite ready for prime time. It's a place to collect notes, quotes, links, and other resources. Part of practicing [[prolific creation]]. It's also a way of [[learn in public]].

I hope that if I get everything out of my head and onto the internet I'll have more room for new stuff.

For updates, check out the [Update Thread](https://twitter.com/GSto/status/1410238607684780032) on Twitter, or view the source on [Github](https://github.com/GSto/digital-garden).

Current goal is to "[do 100 things](https://www.visakanv.com/blog/100-2/)" with this garden. Current count: **{{collections.notes.length}}**
