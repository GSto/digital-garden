# Over The Digital Garden Wall

This is a [[digital garden]] of content that isn't quite ready for prime time. It's a place to collect notes, quotes, links, and other resources. Part of practicing [[prolific creation]]. It's also a way of [[learn in public]].

I hope that if I get everything out of my head and onto the internet I'll have more room for new stuff.
