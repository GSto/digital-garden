# Evergreen Links

_pre-S: I intend to write a brief summary of each of these. Not going to let something being 'incomplete' stop me from putting it out there._

#### [The Gervais Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/) - Vankatesh Rao

The beginning of a set of essays that fundamentally shaped how I think about work and business, told through the lens of _The Office_. It is the perfect entry point to learn about the [[McLeod Hierarchy]]: Businesses are made up of laborers (the losers)(Stanley, Pam), middle management (the clueless)(Dwight, Andy) and owners (the sociopaths)(David Wallace). Understanding the motivations and interactions between these types helps you understand why organizations function the way they function.

#### [Why blacksmiths are better at startups than you](https://stackingthebricks.com/why-blacksmiths-are-better-at-startups-than-you/) - Amy Hoy

Get the basics right. Show up every day. Deliver results. It's a masterclass in working [[empathy]] into your creative process, summed up with this quote:

> Your driving questions will evolve from Does this make me sound smart? to Does this motivate a customer to buy? — from Gee, what do I feel like doing today? to How will I make my customers’ lives better today?

> You’ll make things with your hands and your brain that will help people, people you get to meet, to talk to, to learn from. And you will feel rewarded.

#### [How i won the lottery (tiny subversions) (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_F9jxsfGCw&t=706s) - Darius Kazemi

Many parts of [[the great internet game]] are playing 'hitmaker' games. Take a lot of at bats, and hope you hit some home runs.

#### [Don't end the week with nothing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing) - Patrick MacKenzie

Prefer to work on things you can show. Prefer to work where people can see you. Prefer to work on things you can own. Spend some humtime building either human, social, or reputation capital.

#### [4 kinds of documentation AKA The Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/)

Tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, reference. Get started, solve a problem, know more about a system, grasp a concept. This will change the way you think about creating internal and external documentation.

#### [The wrong abstraction](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) - Sandy Metz

I see this mistake in programming often: removing duplicate code just because it's a duplicate. People forget that the goal of code is not to remove duplication, but to remove complexity.

> Duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction.

#### [CSS utility classes and separation of concerns](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) - Adam Wathan

A well-written treatise on solving a complex software engineering and code organization problem. TailwindCSS is a devisive tool. Even if you don't like using it, it's worth reading Adam's reasoning as to why it's built the way that it is. 

#### [Tech brain](https://pycnocline.substack.com/p/tech-brain) - "Stephanie"

Most of software development is fighting against complexity. However, when engineers over-simply real-world models due to their allergy to complexity, that's "Tech Brain." It can lead to [[false binaries]], overconfidence, and inaccessible or possibly dangerous software.

> an addiction to easy answers combined with a wholesale cultural resistance to any kind of complexity.

#### [Is this you? No really, is this you?](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2020/01/06/is-this-you/) - Mykola Bilokonsky

If you think there is any possibility have autism but were never diagnosed, give this article a read.


#### [r/personalfinance prime directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) 

[flowchart link](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png)

Up until a certain point, where to put your excess cash is a solved problem. 

#### [Fuck you, pay me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkLVRt6c1U) - Mike Monterio

Mike gives a presentation with his lawyer. Every aspiring freelancer should watch this, so they can learn how to protect themselves, and respect themselves.


#### [You blow my mind hey Mickey!](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/magazine/a-rough-guide-to-disney-world.html) - John Jeremiah Sullivan

John Jeremiah Sullivan is my favorite essayist, and this is his best piece. A pair of dads skulk around Disneyland trying to smoke weed. The seedy background activities during a wholesome family trip serve as a metaphor for Disney's sketchy business practices.
