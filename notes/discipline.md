# Discipline

Discipline is domain-dependent. Someone may be disciplined with time, but not with money. With diet, but not with exercise. 

## Discipline as freedom

Discipline and freedom sit sound like they are on opposite sides of a spectrum, but in fact they are connected. Discipline gives you more agency because it gives you more power to follow through on the choices you make. Without discipline, we give up agency to other forces, such as emotion and impulse.

If we want to over the [[Resistance]], it requires discipline. Discipline is required to lives the lives we want to live. 

If you want to work independently. If you don't have the systems, practice, and discipline to work on something when you are doing it part time, you won't be able to do it full-time.

> Socrates demonstrated long ago, that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. - The War of Art

> **In the short term, distractions can keep us from doing the things we want to do. In the longer term, however, they can accumulate and keep us from living the lives we want to live**, or, even worse, undermine our capacities for reflection and self-regulation, making it harder, in the words of Harry Frankfurt, to “**want what we want to want.**” Thus there are deep ethical implications lurking here for freedom, wellbeing, and even the integrity of the self. <footer>Jenny Odell _[How to do Nothing (Kindle link)](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07FLNFRGK&location=2127)_</footer>

## How discipline builds self respect

When you don’t have self-respect, you don’t trust your judgment, therefore don't have the discipline, therefore give into short term pleasures, vices, and other people

When you don't do what you say to yourself you are going to do, you lose trust in yourself and respect for yourself. you start to dislike the roommate in your head. one solution is to declare "trust bankruptcy", start over, and do small things. rebuild the trust within yourself. Building this trust gives you a [[confidence]], knowing that if you say you are going to do something, you are going to make it happen.

> Self-respect is something that our grandparents, whether or not they had it, knew all about. They had instilled in them, young, a certain discipline, the sense that one lives by doing things one does not particularly want to do, by putting fears and doubts to one side, by weighing immediate comforts against the possibility of larger, even intangible, comforts <footer> [On Self-Respect: Joan Didion’s 1961 Essay from the Pages of Vogue](https://www.vogue.com/article/joan-didion-self-respect-essay-1961)</footer>


## Is discipline a muscle or a resource? 
Psychologist Roy Baumeister believed that using discipline, willpower, and making choices led to the depletion of energy and mental fatigue.
