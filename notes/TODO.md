Backlinks are pages that need to be filled in.

Some other ideas I want to implement (I can tackle these after I finish the do 100):

- [x] A way to automatically create a backlists page for tags that don't exist
- [] Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- [x] A way to programmatically calculate number of notes / words in the garden.
- [] Add Google Analytics ( can probably tie it in with the glennstovall.com account, I see no reason to separate them).
- [] Add a way to pick a random "note of the day" to review ideas.
