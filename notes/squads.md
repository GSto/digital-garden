## Squad Benefits
  - "Squads are groups of independent people that work together. House mates are an example. Squads provide resiliency and growth opportunities that are impossible to achieve alone."
  - "Contributions to the squad are positive sum. You help the squad, the squad helps you more because you build social capital. "
  - "Squads = autonomy + community + equity"
  - **Shared resources** - for example, when my mastermind had a "little free library" on Dropbox. 
  - **Shared promotion / WebRing 3.0** - people to help you promote your work to their audiences, upvote on Reddit, etc. 
  - **Emotional Support** someone to help you avoid common failure types, provide advice, help you get unstuck. 

## Squad Stratagems
  - **Little free library** - a shared list of resources
  - **Directory** - listing of people that we can co-promote
  - **Take a gig, leave a gig** - share work we don't want. 
  - **Shared subcontracting** - hire one another to help on each other's projects.
  - **Weekly hangouts**  structured (mastermind style) or unstructured.
  - **Shared knowledge base** some kind of blog / wiki / roam; could be either a public facing [[digital garden]]s or a private internal resource.
