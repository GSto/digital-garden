# Bike-shedding

Giving a disproportionate amount of time and energy towards trivial matters.

Often times, leaders spend time on unimportant and inconsequential decisions. Bike shedding is the act of spending time and energy on those problems when it isn't worth it. 

Why do people do this? Small problems are low stakes and easy to grasp. Big problems are more difficult and complex. People want to solve problems where they feel comfortable.
