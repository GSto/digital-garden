# Career Strategy

## Hypergrowth Startup Strategy
- reliability is paramount.
  - be the person everyone wants to ask to fix something
  - never drop the ball.
- think in problems & skills, not roles. Everyone switches role.
  - You are hired to fix problems, not point them out. Most problems are not hard but there are a lot of them. 
  - A half-fixed problem is worse than no fix at all. You can't resue or build on a 20% solution.
- Everyone's job is to fix/create/setup/improve. 
  - all roles are interim. Hire better people to replace you. 

- avoid stress by maintaining control. 
- Things going wrong is normal. Have risk mitigation strategies.
- Don't work a lot, work quickly and effectively.
  - Don't wait, don't get stuck. switch between issues if you get stuck. 
  - If you are waiting on someone else, see if you can do a good enough version yourself. 
  - Acknowledge quickly, solve async.
- Scale yourself by automating, hiring, empowering

- never load your stress or frustration on others. 
  - if you share a problem share a default solution to avoid 'passing the burden.'

## Career Advancement Strategy
- Get ahead by working hard for yourself (keeping an [[indie mindset]]), such as: 
  - building and maintaining a network
  - getting certifications
  - freelancing and [[consulting]]
  - creating your own products
- exhibit loyalty to people, not organizations
- have a clear definition of what success means to you. 
- find positions of higher [[leverage]], get yourself in better bargaining positions.
- Don't worry about "advanced" tech title bumps like "lead" or "architect."
- If possible, spend less time with programmers and more with project managers, etc. #[[above the code]]
- volunteer to do non-programming work like: 
  - audit processes
  - research projects
  - learn about a domain, bring others up to speed on it. 
- survival is about strength at your own level, confidence is about the illusion of strength above your level. #[[playing up]]
  - Always accept more responsibility, authority, and organizational power. Bite off more than you can chew.
  - Every transfer, promotion, or company switch is a plausible point for narrative enhancement. #[[narrative rationality]]
- look for mutual wins.
- avoid "carnival cash" compensation. (anything that has value within a company but does not have value outside of it.)
- learn [[how to say no]]
