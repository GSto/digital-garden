# Remote Work

Remote work seems to be increasing post COVID-19. It's had some interesting effects on the [[developer job market]]:

- There are more positions open to people across the US, and to some extent the globe. 
- There are more people applying to these positions. 

An increase in remote work leads to an erosion in the lines between work and life. It becomes harder to tell the differences between commercial and non-commercial spaces, and as a consequence of that, the difference between commercial and non-commercial time. Does remote work cause an increase in [[freemium leisure]]?

## Effects of Remote Work During COVID-19
From a study in the Harvard Business Review, though its worth noting that [Quarantine Work is Not Remote Work](https://www.glennstovall.com/quarantine-work-is-not-remote-work/)

- [[productivity]] did not drop, but [[job satisfaction]] and engagement dropped after two weeks.
- People started working longer. They had a more difficult time separating work and home life.
- Will this lead to less travel for work in the long term? 
- On average, people reported being more focused once they got used to the new environment
- The more neurotic you are, the less able you are able to adapt to remote work. 
- The reason remote work is working better than before is because everyone was forced to figure out how to __make__ it work. Previous failures in work from home experiments were most likely failures of implementing work from home well. 
- Remote companies face other challenges: less serendipitous communication, which Steve Jobs designed the Pixar studio to foster, since he saw it as so important. Employee onboarding, creating weak ties, and forging relationships.  #serendipity

Regardless, remote work is here to stay, and everyone will need to learn to adapt.
