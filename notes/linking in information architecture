#Linking in information architecture 

Linking is the best way to integrate information. 

You can provide value to an [[information architecture]] by increasing the amount of links. Linking increases the overall density of the information. This includes nebulous information architectures that exist in organizations. For example, at my software engineering job I can:

* Include links to relevant design files and slack conversations in issue tickets
* Include links to relevant files, tickets, and conversations in PR descriptions. 
* Add links in documentation and tech specs
* Include links to sources in source code
* Attach links to relevant research and data within a spec. 


### Two way linking has value 
Should I link a ticket to a PR or a PR to a ticket? Why not both? You don't know what entry point a person will take. Make it easier for yourself and others to find what they need.
