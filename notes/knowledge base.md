# Knowledge Base

As a knowledge worker, you need somewhere to keep all of the knowledge that you generate.

These can be in different formats: They can be a wiki-style set of pages, a knowledge graph style like this site or [Roam](https://roamresearch.com), or it can be a collection of hierarchal notes like a filesystem or [Evernote](https://evernote.com)

One form of doing this is in public, in a [[digital garden]] format.
