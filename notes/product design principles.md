## Build ironman suits over robots 

Think about building products that can enhance the user's abilities instead of trying to replace the user. Think about the metaphor of the fire flower in Mario. "Automate away" and "enhance the user" are some of the various ways you can empower the user and remove pains.

Compare the example of trying to build an AI tool that writes articles for you, versus one that helps a human authorize iterate and refine their ideas. Which tool do you think will produce better results? 

## Every business is dysfunctional and insane 

Every business is dysfunctional, and will have weird quirks in the way they do business. Sometimes businesses will not adhere to what you think they "should" be like. Useful software should be flexible enough to let people support their own processes.

inspired by the [[30x500]] way of thinking about product. ways of removing pain

- **Educate**: teach someone to do it themselves
- **Equip**: Give them the tools, supplies, components they need
- **Support**: Help others overcome fear, anxiety, avoidance, etc.
- **Access:** connect people to stuff, people, or places that they cannot reach or afford.
- **Outsource:** automate work or connect them to outsources.
- **Eliminate** change, bypass, or eliminate the pain entirely.

## The user is a crazy, lazy drunk

Or at least, we should consider them to be as such when using our software. They will skim or ignore text, they will make typos, they will misclick. Take note that I don't say the user is *dumb*, you can be drunk and smart. This is about acknowledging that we are all humans, humans, make mistakes. 

## Confirm or undo

Since we assume the user is going to make mistakes, give them a way out. Either ask for confirmation, or give them a way to undo the mistake. Doing so gives the user confidence in your software, and removes anxiety form using it. Undo is preferred but not always feasible.
