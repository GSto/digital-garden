# Talking points

Points I find myself coming back to repeatedly. 

* Action produces information
* Excess comfort produces weakness
* If you're bored than you're boring
* cultivate an indie mindset
* The internet is a game where if you play well you get a house 
* The goal is to make a bunch of money with computers, then never touch a computer again



* pop culture stopped evolving in 2005
* the american empire peaked that summer we were all playing Pokemon Go
