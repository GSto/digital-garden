# Writing Book Recommendations

### [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/194564401X)
Written in 1918, revised in 1935, still the best book on writing there is. Often assigned to college students en masse and can be found in used book stores everywhere. 

### [On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816)
Half auto biography, half about writing. Oddly I like King's storytelling here more than I do any of his novels. 

### [On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction)
Primer on writing articles and essays. Useful for jounralists and bloggers alike. 

### [The War of Art](https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B007A4SDCG/)
Learn how to overcome internal Resistance and get work done on your craft. More about the internal stuggle of writing than about writing itself. 

### [Artful Sentences: Syntax as Style](https://www.amazon.com/Artful-Sentences-Syntax-as-Style/dp/0961392185)
About developing a style as an author. Useful for understanding the rhythm that makes writing like [This sentence has five words](https://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2014/08/05/this-sentence-has-five-words/) so powerful.

### [The Associated Press Stylebook](https://www.amazon.com/AP-Stylebook-55th-Associated-Press-ebook/dp/B089JBPSJH)
Reference book, not for reading. Helpful for answering questions about styling of modern words you may not find in a dictionary. Also includes guidance for writing about certain topics, for example, "how to turn earnings reports into a story." When I managed a content team this was frequently used to settle debates.

Also, the best inspiration is reading writing that you aspire to be like, whoever or whatever that is.
