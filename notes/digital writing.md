# Digital Writing

The style of writing used online, typically in public places. Examples include blog articles, [[Twitter]] threads, communicating in slack, [[evergreen notes]] if you're doing the [[learn in public]] thing, etc.

Contrast with other forms of writing, digital writing is about frequent publishing ([[prolific creation]]), [[experimentation]], and iteration. Write shorter, write quicker. When ideas test well, you can expand upon them. 

proven tweets -> short articles -> long articles -> books, courses, etc
