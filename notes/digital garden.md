# Digital Gardens 

An open database of unfinished blog posts. Think like the roam database or Wiki, but open to the public. 

## Why A Digital Garden? 

Digital Garden's combine a few different ideas. The first is evergreen note taking. Notes in a digital garden are meant to be edited, refined, added to, and updated over time. They accumulate across time and across projects. Second is synthesis. Since the structure of a digital garden grows organically, you hope to discover connections between ideas you otherwise wouldn't have. Combining and refining ideas are core to [[creativity]], since [everything is a remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc&ab_channel=KirbyFerguson). 

Thirdly, digital gardens tend to be online, and function as a way to [[learn in public]]. 

Since notes can be more "raw" than articles or larger forms of work, I also find they help with [[prolific creation]]. Keeping a digital garden gives me a way to get ideas out into the world faster.
