## Using The Blockchain
There are several wallets available to use multiple types of cryptocurrencies. 

## Developing on The Blockchain
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - used for setting up a Solidity development environment.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) - another development environment
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - Online IDE
- [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.0/) - [[Ethereum]] [[Javascript]] API
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) - Another [[Ethereum]] [[JavaScript]] API. 

## Buying, Selling, and Trading Cryptocurrency

I mostly use [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) for ease of use. It supports "mainstream" coins. 
[Binance](https://binance.com) is another popular one.
