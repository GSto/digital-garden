Notes and techniques for better systematic inquiry

## Elements of a research project 
- Topic selection 
- Research question formation 
- Information gathering
- Hypothesizing & Thesis generation
- Synthesis
- Production

## Topic selection 

### Keep an idea journal 
Start some form of [[note taking]] to jot down ideas and questions you come across. You will find your own way for generating ideas. the important thing is to start. As with so many other aspects of independent scholarship, it is the doing that teaches us how.

Examples of "intellectual journals" you can look to for inspiration: source: The Independent Scholar
- Eric Hoffer, Working and thinking on the waterfront
- Adelbert Ames Jr., The morning notes 
- Paul Goodman, Five Years
- John Robben, Coming to my senses 
- Jessamyn West, Hide and Seek
- Charles Darwin, Diary of the Voyage of HMS Beagle
- André Gide, The Journals of André Gide
- Andy Warhol, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again)
- Anais Nin, A Woman Speaks: The Lectures, Seminars, and Interviews of Anais Nin
- Henry Thoreau, The Journal 
- Christopher Isherwood, Kathleen and Frank
- Suzanne Mitchell, My Own Woman: The Diary of an Analysis

### Recon new realms of knowledge
Do recon on a new source of knowledge. Browse a local library and online on the topic. Keep moving, and keep a list. You are compiling your "little black book" of intellectual attractions - books, ideas, authors, points of view, realms of fact or imagination with which you want to make a date sometime, get to know better, and perhaps fall in love with. 

Start browsing books, magazines, and other media sources to get a sense of the subject. Find places to hang out with people. 

## Writing good research questions 


- Focus on a single topic.
- Avoid value judgements. - Don't use words like "good", "bad", "better", or "worse." Find more clear criteria for your question.
- The more specific, the better.
- Should not be answerable with a "yes" or "no." This "how" instead. More scope here leads to more room for investigation and discussion.
- Shouldn't be too easy to answer. If you can answer it with a simple Google search, you haven't found a big enough gap in knowledge to be interesting.
- Aim to answer a timely debate.
- Don't dig into questions that have already been answered.

Below are templates to get you started, try to think of questions that make sense in the context of your project.

### Research question templates 


- Describing and exploring
  - What are the characteristics of X?
  - How has X changed over time?
  - What are the causes of X?
  - How has X dealt with Y?
- Explaining and testing

- Inspired by [[species of interesting ideas]] ( don't forget to invert!)
  - Does X appear disorganized, but is in reality a structured phenomenon?
  - Is X actually a collection of dissimilar elements?
  - Does X appear local, but is actually global?
  - Is X stable or is it changing?
  - Is X efficient or inefficient?
  - Do X and Y appear related but aren't?
  - Can X and Y co-exist?
  - Is the positive correlation between X & Y actually a negative one?
  - Do X & Y appear to be similar, but are actually opposites?
- From [Just Enough Research](https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research)
  - Is X the right problem to be solving?

  - How long has X really been going on?
  - How do you define the success of X?
  - What concerns do you / other people have about X?
  - What are greatest challenges around X?
  - What are the most common tasks related to X?
  - What problems have you noticed with X?
  - What workarounds to people have with X?
- Applied research questions 
  - Are there any quick wins to move towards X?
  - What are effective tactics for X?
  - How will you measure progress on X?

## Developing a research project
The important part of the first project is not that it succeeds but that it is yours. Because it is your first piece of original research, you do not have to worry about whether or not it succeeds. One of the purposes of the first project is for you to decide what success means to you in this kind of activity.

1. Write up a project plan (~1 page) it should include a 1-2 sentence brief, your plan for research, projected outcomes with a timeline, how to get feedback, who would be interested, and how they can be reached. 
2. Before reading, come up with some theories of your own. It helps you think for yourself instead of following what other people think. 
3. Start forming questions and a research plan
4. Begin drafting as findings begin to emerge
5. complete the work
6. distribute as needed

## Writing a research project description 

1. Describe the project - list objectives in order of their performance Why did you select it? What was the original impuse?
2. What are the anticipated major problems?
3. What form is the project going to take?
4. What people are going to help on this project?
5. What is the budget for costs, materials, books, equipment, fees, etc.
6. List of books
7. When will your project be completed and presented?
8. What other projects do you have going on? How much time per week can you give to the project?
9. Could you teach someone about this topic later?
10. How is this project valuable to you?
11. Who will critique your project?

## Resarch tactics 
  * Use scholar.google.com, or other source to find several articles & books. Pull as many relevant sentences and quotes as you can from those pieces. Sort them and look for themes. Form thesises from the patterns you find. 
  * Comparing yourself to previous work or at least acknowledging related work is universally necessary. It helps better inform your work. 
  * idea: separate the "research" from the writing. Those are two activities with different outcomes.
  * Remember that your research needs to tell a story. #[[storytelling]] (note: this may be more of a "writing" problem than a research problem.)
  * Skimming - read the first and last paragraph of articles, and scan and headlines before committing to read the entire piece.
  * Google queries for finding statistics 
    * “State of [topic]”
    * “[Topic] report”
    * “[Topic] survey”
    * “[Topic] statistics”
    * “[Topic] case study”
    * “[Topic] examples

## Data collection methods 

* [[sales safari]]
* Reading articles & books
* Research papers
* Finding statistics
* Googling it
* Youtube search
* Twitter search 
* Find Aggregators on Twitter
* Build Twitter lists of 
  * researchers - prominent people
  * News aggregators
  * Founders / VCs (if applicable) 

## How to read a research paper 
from [How to read a research paper quickly & effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv5ku0eoY6k) 
Read the title, it should explain the method and result

* read the abstract - it explains why, methods, and result
* read the first and last paragraph of the introduction - summarize the hypothesis and results
* read headings of results 
* read conclusion
* if it looks useful - look for specific points in the results
* read limitations if available
* look for other references that look interesting to dive into later. 

## Pitfalls of research 
- Failing to read predecessors in his field, waste time researching a subject that has already been done.
- Being ignorant of bibliographical methods or standards. Believing that any book is a reliable source.
- Not knowing where to go for reliable information or service.
- Not knowing how to read carefully or write precisely.
- Lacking a legitimate reason for writing on the topic - A nonexistent or unimportant problem.
- Lacking a wide background and being able to provide a proper perspective on a topic
- Naively injecting predjucies and assumptions
- Lacking logical thinking. Thus, present conclusions that do not follow from his evidence, or misinterpreted evidence
- Not knowing how to take accurate notes
- Resisting the temptation to include colorful or amusing scenes and anecdotes that only have journalistic value

## Types of research 
There are different ways to think about research, most of which I've had some interest in. Some of these might be the same, but aim to give me an idea of where to start looking.

* **Scientific research** - forming experiments, trying to discover information
* **Journalistic research** - finding, and verifying sources
* **Writing research papers** - easier entry point, since students do it. 
* **Product research** - for work, in product, growth, customer research, etc. 
* **Personal research** - research about a person specifically. "Who is Jeff Bezos?" 
* **Applied research** - research designed to fix a real-world goal
* **Design research** - research to help inform design decisions
* **Generative research** - deciding what problems to solve, looking for new ideas, looking for unmet needs. 
* **Organization research** - understanding how an organization works, who is involved, and what their priorities are.
* **User research** - understand the needs and priorities of your users

## Research classes 
* Librarian - collector of books and resources, great at finding connections
* Scholar - large expertise in a limited field
* Reporter - general interests, good at evaluating evidence, favors sharing over learning
* Detective - primarily interested in human behavior, the motive behind stories, and uncovering secrets
* Scientist - interested in running experiments, data
* Clinician - looks for practical insights via in-field practice
* Philosopher - seeks wisdom through reflection and dialogue
* Activist - searches for new ideas via reflection and action
