# CrossFit for Writing 

A 1-2 hour process for going from idea to draft of an article

* called 'crossfit' because each section is timed, and designed for high-intensity. 
		* "the clock silences the ego" - it helps you get used to having work come through you instead of from you. 
		* designed to get a "blurry image" - 100% of the features, but less done. That's better than a fractional 25% of a piece
		* Preparing for a crossfit session: 
			* choose a topic - know what you're going to write about 
			* gather notes - spend some time gathering notes on ideas you've already had or things you've already ready 
			* don't do outside research - pull from things you've already consumed. Ask yourself "why did I have that idea". 
		* Push yourself when doing these sessions. You want it to be high intensity. You should be tired when you're done.  

## The process

1. **pick an idea that resonates** (2 minutes) - off the cuff, from experience, zero research. Pick a highlight or a note that resonates with you. 
2. **collect 5 ideas related to the main one** (5 minutes) - from memory & notes. do a brain dump. no judgement include everything
3. [[progressive summarization]] (2 minutes) - bold key ideas & phrases, then highlight from the bolded section. helps you uncover the core message
4. **Arrange your ideas in a logical sequence** (5 minutes) - lots of [possible sequences](https://wr1ter.com/logical-order) don't over think it. It can help to come up with a summary(best bits & takeaways), thesis(what the piece is trying to prove or disprove) or an abstract(what the essay is about).
5. Two conflicting versions here: 
	1. Bolster with more notes from your notebooks
	2. Make it POP ([[POP Writing]]) - Personal (stories and experience), Observational (keen and insightful), Playful (funny and quirky)
6. **Create a short outline** (5 minutes): 5-10 bullet outline, build narrative flow, think of transition points (use but, therefore transitions)
7. **Write a "blurry thumbnail"** (15 minutes), a 200-word, high level view of your piece. Another way to think of this is a 3 50-word paragraph version. 
8. Feedback (optional) - what's boring? delete. what's confusing? clarify. What's interesting? expand.
9. **Write your shitty first draft** (30 miutes) - flesh out the details. resist the urge to do any editing
10. Rest, let it breathe, edit for clarity and transitions, publish and share it online
