# Solana

- cryptocurrency based on a “proof of history” algorithm. designed to be a fast, cheap chain to execute contracts on.
- Whereas it costs ~$3 today to do a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, and ~$8-40 on Ethereum, **it costs $0.0001 to do a transaction on Solana**.
- Backing by important people, which is important since  [[cryptoeconomics]] is all about people and narratives: 
    - a16z is an investor
    - Sam-Bankman Fried is building a new decentralized exchange(dex) on Solana.

## The Bull Case
    - first there was bitcoin, a digital decentralized currency. next came [[Ethereum]], which allowed for whole decentralized applications.(dapps for short)
    - first real use case of dapps are NFTs. unique tokens so far used for digital art.
    - [[NFT]]s have been embraced by mainstream companies, including Marvel, Visa, NBA, and Arizona Iced Tea.
    - other potential uses of dapps, movement is called “[[web3]]”
    - biggest constraint is cost. Ethereum and btc transactions have a cost(gas) and are slow.
    - Solana is the tech needed to make [[web3]] bigger and faster than before. Solena fixes this
    - The cost of other. networks like [[Ethereum]] are a limiting factor.
    - The other limiting factor is developers. Solana is making an effort to be as developer friendly as possible, and encourage building on their platform. 

## The Bear Case
    - If demand in crypto in general decreases or there is a bear crypto market, people may be less inclined to build on newer technologies and instead focus on more tried and true protocols (again, [[Ethereum]]).
    - will people be hesitant to adopt yet another blockchain?

## Solana Projects
    - Serum, Saber, Audius, Star Atlas

## Developing on Solana
- Programs (smart contracts) can be written in [[Rust]], C++, or C.
- Use the solana [web3-sdk](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) to interact with the chain via JavaScript
- Also has an available [JSON API](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api)
