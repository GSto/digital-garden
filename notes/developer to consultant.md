## Flavors of Technical Consulting
- Source: [this comment on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/i20eqw/getting_a_new_job_in_a_new_path/g0302cs/?context=3), based on Amazon positions
  - **Account Manager **- coordinate everyone else involved with the account
  - **Solutions Architect** - Similar ro sales people, they are showing customers "[[the art of the possible]]" and working with customers to show what can be done. May or may not be hands on. 
  - **Engagement Managers** - similar to scrum masters or project masters
  - **Technical Consultants** - actually working with customers and developing solutions
  - **Technical Account Managers** - provides ongoing support. Constantly on call.  
  - **Fractional CTO** - fill the CTO role for a company that doesn't have the resources to hire a full-time one.

## Example Service Offerings
- **Corporate Training**

  ## Notes
  - Idea from the [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/) discord: use an existing book / framework to try and bootstrap a consulting practice. For example, scrum / agile practices. Quote from the channel: 
    - One opportunity that's been mildly helpful for me to do more strategic work is to leverage existing strategy books+frameworks in your domain that you can then apply for your 'client' (be it an actual client or an internal one).
    - By reading & considering a decent business book* somewhat deeply you: 
        - Will be 95% ahead of the game where most people have heard the meme but have no idea what the substance is.
        - Have a bunch of thinking done for you -- no need to start from scratch.
        - Can leverage the authority & credibility of the authors behind the book... and cover your ass somewhat if it fails.
        - Can look at existing case studies where [whatever framework] worked/failed and use that community knowledge.
        - Bootstrap your way to your own DIY framework: https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/06/27/frameworks/  :)
        - Use the strategy + implementation as a one-off, test-the-waters project, rather a whole career-level commitment.

- Old thread from Adam Wathan about [[productized services]] and [[value-based pricing]]. [Source](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1193132593996292096): "Value based pricing is absolutely the best approach for work that can be productized, but custom software development is not that type of work."
- Interesting thread on "software as solutions": McKinsey has started buying software and selling solutions to clients, instead of pure strategy. I suppose selling solutions is higher leverage than selling strategy?  Maybe the real play is this: solution > strategy > labor. [Thread Link](https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1349431711491264518?s=20)
- Found that the **Entrepreneurial coder podcast** looks like a great resource for learning about [[independent work]] and developers-to-consultants types. It appears the most common bridge is training products, and then training services. 


## Open Questions
- How important is large company experience when it comes to consulting? The [Yak Collective](https://www.yakcollective.org/) seems to think its important enough to include on their brief member directory page. Is it a 'requirement?'
- How can **developers work in higher-context** and **share the problem** with stakeholders?
- Who has made the developers to consultants leap, and who has a business like I want? What can I learn from them?
