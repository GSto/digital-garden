> "People remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks."

When you leave tasks unfinished, they tend to stick in your head. This hurts your ability to [[focus]] on current tasks. 

The [[getting things done]] system is designed to combat this. When you put a task in your inbox, you can consider it "taken care of." Therefore you are taking the cognitive load out of your head and moving it elsewhere.
