# Digital postcards
A digital postcard is a recurring (typically weekly) newsletter or blog post about what you are already doing, thinking, and feeling. 

The goal of digital postcards is to optimize for consistency not quality. Make them a light lift. Keep it fast, easy and fun. 

This way, you can maintain a consistent cadence while still taking time to work on longer form, higher quality pieces.
