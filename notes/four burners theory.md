# Four Burners Theory

Imagine that your life is represented by a stove with four burners on it. Each burner symbolizes one major quadrant of your life.

- The first burner represents your **family**.
- The second burner is your **friends**.
- The third burner is your **health**.
- The fourth burner is your **work**.


The Four Burners Theory says that â€œin order to be successful you have to cut off one of your burners. And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two.
