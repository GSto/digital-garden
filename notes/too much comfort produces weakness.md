> Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.

- Michael Hopf

As [[stressors]] can provide strength to [[antifragile]] systems, conversely, a lack of stressors can lead to weakness.

## Examples

- Roman statesman Cato the Censor saw all comfort as weakness. If things were too easy he worried about a weakening of the will.
- A lack of [[strength training]] or other exercise leads to weakness in muscles.
- Horses compete better against strong competition than they do against weaker horses. They need the challenge to thrive.
