# Bullshit

Inspired by Harry G Frankfurt's essay [On Bullshit](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit), bullshit is a term I use to describe babble that is neither true nor false. In software engineer, project estimates are a common form of bullshit. Think of this way: 

```
facts:      truthiness == true
lies:       truthiness == flase
bullshit:   truthiness == null
```
