# Bullshit

Inspired by Harry G Frankfurt's essay [On Bullshit](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit), bullshit is a term I use to describe babble that is neither true nor false. In software engineer, project estimates are a common form of bullshit. Think of this way: 

```
facts:      truthiness == true
lies:       truthiness == false
bullshit:   truthiness == null
```

bullshit is something that can be "[Not Even Wrong](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong)", because it fails to meet the criteria where correctness or incorrectness can be determined.

**Brandolini's Law** - "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than to produce it." #[[eponymous laws]].
