# Progressive Summarization

The act of re-reviewing notes to make them richer and more valuable. Includes bolding certain texts, and adding links (both to other notes and to external resources) to make them richer.

 **Add value to a note every time you touch it.** Don't expect to have a perfect plan, just do it. Treat knowledge like a code base and occasionally do refactoring and maintenance. 

Notes evolve over time. Just because a note is evergreen does not it mean it needs to ever be complete. One method of doing this is **progressive summarization**: As you read and re-read notes, edit and improve them as you go along. Examples include:

- bolding or re-organizing text
- adding links to other notes and external resource
- budding a note into more, smaller notes.
