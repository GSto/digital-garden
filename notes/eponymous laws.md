## Conway's Law

> "Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."

## Gall's Law

## Parkinson's Law

> "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". Same Parkinson as "Parkinson's Law of Triviality"

## Parkinson' Law of Triviality

> "people within an organization commonly or typically give disproportionate weight to trivial issues."

Parkinson provides the example of a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bike shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task. AKA bicycle-shed effect, bike-shed effect, and [[bike-shedding]]

## Peter Principle
