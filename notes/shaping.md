# Shaping 

AKA Project Roadmapping, AKA Solutions Design

The phase in a project between [[requirements gathering]] and beginning the work. The art of examining constraints and resources in order to design a solution to a problem. Term is inspired by the Basecamp book, [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

Shaping involves identifying **risks** and **rabbit holes.** Rabbit holes are unanswered questions that could cause trip ups in development. Reducing unknowns and therefore risks is the primary value add of shaping. 

Shaping involves setting the **appetite** for the solution. How much time and resources are you willing to invest in the solution? This is a more useful question than asking for a estimate, and focusing on "how long it might take."

Shaping is still early enough to walk away from a project. It's simply a time to explore ideas. 

Shaping should also define **no-gos**. Anything specifically excluded from the concept. Functionality or use cases we intentionally aren't convering. Defining these contours increases [[legibility]] for both sides.

## Factors to consider for project-wide shaping
- What are the hard requirements for this project?
- Which requirements are flexible (and thus, not requirements)?
- What are the constraints of this project? 
- What is ongoing support plan for this project? 
- What do we need to do to guarantee the security of the application? 
- What 3rd party integrations will this project involve? 
- What are the risks involved with this project? 
- Do we require any data form internal or 3rd party sources? How will we get that data into the new system? 


## Questions to help with shaping features
- Where in the system does the new thing fit? 
- How do you get to it? 
- What are the key components or interactions?
- Where does it take you?

## Questions to help identify rabbit holes:
- Does this require technical we've never done before? 
- Are we making assumptions about how parts fit together? 
- Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance since it doesn't trip up the team?

## Shaping Artifacts
- **Fat Marker Sketches.** Shaping is typically too early to start fleshing out a full UI. Instead, use some kind of rough visualization to explain ideas. 
- **Roadmapping Documents** Documents including the information above, outling the key features of the application. Can also include estimated costs and price.
- **Solutions Architecture** documents & graphs. For project wide shaping, you may also include documentation outling what the technical resources will be.
