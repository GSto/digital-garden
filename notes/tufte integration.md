# Tufte Integration 

#: Extended markdown syntax to support Tufte-inspired layouts

## Brief

This is both a sandbox and documentation for integrating this site with [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and Markdown.

## Implemented Features 

### Section organizations
content is automatically segmented into sections based on H2 tags. 

### Sidenotes 

One of the most distinctive features of Tufteâ€™s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.^[this is a sidenote]. If you add multiple sidenotes throughout your notes, then they will number themselves automatically.^[this, for example, should show up as sidenote **number** 2. As you can see, you can nest markdown in these to style the texts]. Here is how you add a sidenote: 

```
^[this is the side note syntax]
```

### Margin notes 

Margin notes are similar to sidenotes, but they don't have  number atached to them.>[but they still show up on the side of the page]

```
>[this is a margin note syntax]
```

### Epigraph Quotes
By default, blockquotes will be rendered as an epitaph

### Page subtitles

Page subtitles can be created with the following syntax: 

```
#: this is a subtitle
```

## Future development
Tufte CSS features that aren't yet implemented, but on my to-do list: 

2. epitaph citations
3. newthought paragraph start
4. figures
5. margin figures
6. iframe wrappers
7. image quilts

## Resources
The plan is to use a combination of custom markdown parsing and shortcodes to implement as much of Tufte CSS as possible.
