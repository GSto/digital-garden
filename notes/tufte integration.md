# Tufte Integration 

This is both a sandbox and documentation for integrating this site with [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and Markdown.

## Implemented Features 

### Epigraph Quotes
By default, blockquotes will be rendered as an epitaph

## Resources
The plan is to use a combination of custom markdown parsing and shortcodes to implement as much of Tufte CSS as possible.
