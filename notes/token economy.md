# Token Economy

A system where you earn visible but meaningless tokens for "good behavior", where good behavior is defined by what the creator of the system wants you to do. 

## Examples of Token Economies

- **Behavior:** working extra hours, doing work outside the scope of your job description
- **Tokens:** internal rewards, titles, or other rewards that aren't transferrable outside of the company.
