## Elements of deliberate practice
* Deliberate practice exercises are granular
* exercises are designed to simulate real word (contest) situations
* deliberate practice is painful and requires [[mental toughness]]. It should push you to your limit. 
* Uses well-established training techniques, if they exist in the field you are practicing
* Preferably under the guidance of a coach when possible
* deliberate practice involves modifying existing [[mental models]] of a skill. 

## Designing drills 
* When coming up with new skills, ask "what captures something that players will have to do in a real match?"
* Watching videos of people doing what you want to do can help give you ideas of skills, and how they are done. 
* Once you develop an exercise, see if you can use the skill in a real world situation. If not, tweak the drill. 

## Deliberate practice vs. Holistic simulations
Deliberate practice is doing drills of specific, granular skills. Holistic simulations (In martial arts, known as [randori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randori)) are activities that simulate the entire sport or skill. Drills are a science, practice is an art. 

* Deliberate practice drills can't teach the holistic skill of putting everything together. You still need to simulate the whole activity. 
* Drills can't teach 'sensibilities.' Those can only be learned through a large volume of real world experience. What are sensibilities? It's how your body reacts before your mind knows what its doing. ([[tacit knowledge]])
* Deliberate drills cannot prepare you for [[randomness]], unlike more holistic simulations. 
* Play. Consider the difference between running scales on the guitar and playing your favorite songs. What's the point of building [[expertise]] if you can't have fun with it? 


## Examples of breaking down a skill into deliberate practice 

There are times in a Judo match when you realize that you cannot throw your opponent, and your advantage might lie with attacking them on the ground. In order to do this you need to:

- Bring them, legally, to the ground
- Be fast enough to get to a dominant attacking position on the ground
- If necessary, to keep them on the ground (which means to keep them on all fours)
- Execute the newaza technique (be it pin, choke, or armlock).
