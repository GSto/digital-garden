# Effectual Reasoning

> You bake with the flour you have.
> - Danish folk saying

A way to examine where you are to decide where you want to go next. Means-based thinking over ends-based thinking. Instead of asking yourself "where do I want to go, and how can I bridge the gap?", instead think of "based on where I am now, where can I go from here?" 

By definition, whatever you have is exactly what you need to produce your **best** work.

## Taking an Effectual Reasoning Inventory

- **Who are you** — What are my natural strengths, traits, and abilities? (e.g. – You are a very analytically minded person). 

- **Who do you know** — Who are in my social and professional networks? (e.g. – You have one friend that runs a food company similar to the snack bar company you’d like to start).

- **What do you know** — What is my training, expertise, interests and experience (e.g. – You have read a few articles on Google Adwords Pay Per Click (PPC) Marketing and find it interesting).
