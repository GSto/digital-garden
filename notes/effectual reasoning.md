# Effectual Reasoning

> You bake with the flour you have.
> - Danish folk saying

A way to examine where you are to decide where you want to go next. Means-based thinking over ends-based thinking. Instead of asking yourself "where do I want to go, and how can I bridge the gap?", instead think of "based on where I am now, where can I go from here?" 

By definition, whatever you have is exactly what you need to produce your **best** work.
