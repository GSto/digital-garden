# Humor 

Humor = a combination of wit, speed, tonality, confidence, daring, nonconformity, flexibility with language, understanding of audience, and more. (source: [Storyworthy](https://www.amazon.com/Storyworthy-Engage-Persuade-through-Storytelling/dp/1608685489))

Humor is based on **surprise**. 

If you want a story to resonate, don't end on a joke. End on something moving. 

Humor can be used to add contrast within serious stories. #[[storytelling]]

## Humor Tactics

- **Milk Cans and a Baseball** -- AKA Setup and punchline. The more time you spend setting up the milk cans, the more potential there is to be realized from the punchline. Think about ordering information and make sure that the funniest part comes __last__ and the rest is used for buildup. 
- **Odd Metaphors and Comparisons** - a mini version of setup/punchline. Example: "A car the size of a box of Pop-Tarts" 
- **Funny words** - some words are just funny, it's unclear why. "K" words for example. Pickle. Digit. Cattywumpus. 
- **Get Specific** - “I’m pouring water over Raisin Bran because I am too stupid and lazy to buy milk” is funnier than “I’m pouring water over a bowl of cereal.”
-  **Babies and Blenders** - push two things that rarely go together together. Sesame Street leverages this game in "one of these things is not like the others." 
- **Exaggeration** - a mini form of babies and blenders. Only works if its clear the exaggeration is intended to be for effect and not dishonest.
