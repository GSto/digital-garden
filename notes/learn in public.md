Coined by [Swyx](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), the idea that you should learn in public by creating content and sharing what you learn. When you do this, you teach yourself better, as well as helping others. 

Working out in the open helps you connect with like-minded people. Imagine it as working with the garage doors up. 

Working in public helps you build more capital, in the form of social and reputational capital. As Patrick MacKenzie puts it: 

* Work on things you can show. 
* Work where people can see you. 
* Work on things you can keep.
