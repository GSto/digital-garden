# Risk of Ruin

> "You can be risk loving and yet completely averse to ruin." <footer>Nassim Taleb</footer>

Risk brings reward, but the risk of ruin should be avoided. Don't play with money you can't lose. 

To get around this, I **think of my own money as barbelled**. I take risks with one portion and am terrified with the other. Don't bet in aggressive strategies what you can't afford to lose.
