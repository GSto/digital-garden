# foster passions with rigor

Passions aren't found, they're made. They're forged by putting effort, time, and energy into what we enjoy. This insight comes from Angela Duckworth's research in _Grit_.

## fun requires rigor

What we call "fun" often requires hard work and rigor to access. Athletes train rigorously because winning is fun. Learning to play guitar takes considerable effort, but when you reach a level of competence where you can improvise and jam, it becomes immensely enjoyable. The fun comes after the work, not instead of it.

## reframing our relationship with effort

Many people, myself included, have a negative relationship with effort and hard work. We think it's something to be avoided, even though when we do it meaningfully it brings us joy. If all you did was sit around and play Playstation all day, you would be incredibly sad and bored. People tend to run from their jobs because they hate them, and think relaxing would make them feel better. Instead, what you should pursue is increasing the time, energy, effort, and attention to things you enjoy, things to fill your heart.

## focus enables enjoyment

Research shows [a wandering mind is an unhappy mind](https://x.com/JEverettLearned/status/1940952313398808609). We enjoy tasks more when we focus on them ([Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010](https://sci-hub.st/10.1126/science.1192439)). The paper also shows play ranks high on the happiness scale. When you can play and focus in, you'll be happier.
