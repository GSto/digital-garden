# Accessibility

## Tactics

### Images
  - Images should have alt text, unless they don't convey information. In that case, they should have a 'role='presentation' attribute.
  - ### Text
      - text should have enough contrast to be readable. Contrast should be at least 4.5:1
      - Text should be readable when the screen is zoomed in to 200%
      - Blocks of text are no more than 80 characters wide. 
      - Lines should have at least a 1.5 line height.
  - ### Forms
      - Form buttons have a descriptive value. 
      - Form inputs have associated text labels. 
  - ### Media
      - a text transcript is provided to non-live audio-only files. 
      - Synchronized captions are provided for non-live video. 
      - Controls are provided to stop, pause, mute, or adjust audio volume. 
  - ### Headings
      - Headings should be in order and match the layout of the content (don't jump from h1 -> h3 for example)
  - ### Color
      - color is not used as the sole method of conveying content or distinguishing visual elements. 

## Guidelines

### POUR
  - **Perceivable** - can users perceive the content? 
  - **Operable** - can users use the UI components to navigate the content? 
  - **Understandable** - can users understand the content? 
  - **Robust** - Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of user agents and browsers? Does it work with assistive technology?
