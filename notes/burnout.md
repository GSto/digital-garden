Notes from this developer community keynote: [the thing about burnout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeDks5BJCQQ&ab_channel=GoogleCloud) 

## Why is there so much burnout for engineers? 

1. **Social status theory** - People are acting more burnt out then they are. Being seen as "tired" or "busy" is a positive [[status]] symbol. 
2. **Social media** - both looking at highlight reels and trying to get our own likes and engagement, maintaining a [[personal brand]]. being extremely online leads to lower self evaluations
3. **Constant availability**  - "hero syndrome", an addiction to always be the one to save the day, instead of focusing on knowledge sharing

## 8 phases of burnout 

1. **Honeymoon phase **- Excited, energetic. common at a new job
2. **Onset of stress** - Some days are more difficult than others, slightly less optimistic, more tired
3. **Neglecting yourself** - Postponing [[self-care]] just to get the job done. relying on unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking too much to relieve stress.
4. **Interpersonal problems at home & at work** - is there a tension, are the vibes off? Things you used to love aren't as fun anymore.
5. **Reduced performance & cognitive problems** - interferes with ability to concentrate, concentration becomes incredibly difficult.
6. **Can't get excited about work anymore** - feeling cynical about working conditions
7. **Physical symptoms** - digestive issues, constant exhaustion
8. **Total burnout** - don't feel you can do your job at all, feels like only solution is a new job.

## 7 tips to avoid burnout 

1. **Get clarity** - Only half of workers know what is expected of them.
2. **Stop multitasking** - Focus on one thing at a time. Multitasking as a general rule reduces productivity. It also prevents space for deeper reflection, contemplation, and learning.
3. **Set healthy boundaries** - It's your job to communicate your limits and say no.
4. **Take control of your notifications** - Turn off all notifications.
5. **Find something outside of work that you are passionate about** - Something challenging and engaging.
6. **Have a clear line between work and life**
7. **Get enough sleep** - Don't work from bed; lack of sleep and burnout are a vicious downward spiral.
