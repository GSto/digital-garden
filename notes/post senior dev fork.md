# Post Senior Dev Fork
Where do developers go after becoming a senior? 

Potential next steps, as outlined in this article about [growing as a senior engineer](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-grow-as-a-senior-engineer-or-why-i-got-a-new-job/swizec/9438) by [Swizec Teller](https://swizec.com/), appended based on my experience:
  - You can go into **management**
  - You can become a **architect**
  - You can start a business and be an **entrepreneur**
  - You can become a **consultant** ([[consulting]], [[developer to consultant]])
  - You can join a **bigger company with bigger problems**
  - You could also get into **training**.
