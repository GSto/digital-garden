# Complexity

- Measuring complexity: [Halstead Complexity Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures) Measures complexity at the function level like so: 
    - number of distinct operators (function calls, syntax elements)
    - number of distinct operands (variables)
    - total number of operators (how often you use those operands)
    - total number of operands (how oftern you use those variables)
    - By refactoring code into smaller methods, you can reduce the number of distinct operators and operands in a function, moving that complexity to another location. However do this too much and you would end up increasing the number of distinct operators.
- Types of complexity in technology: 
    - branching complexity - how many different outcomes are there? 
    - data access complexity - are there permissions
- Measuring complexity in [[object-oriented programming]] 
    - __(Chidamber, S.R.; Kemerer, C.F. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering Volume 20, Issue 6, Jun 1994 Page(s):476 - 493)__
    - methods per class
    - coupling between object classes
    - response for a class(?)
    - number of children
    - depth of inheritance tree
    - lack of cohesion of methods
- Examples of product level complexity:
    - Authentication / Permissons: number of users, roles, permissions. 
- Is there a way to quantify complexity at the UX and/or product level? #[[Open Questions]]
