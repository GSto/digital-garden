# Engineering Management Reading 

My pipeline of engineering management related reading. 

## Bird's eye view 
"Engineering management" is not a skill. Any book about management is by default a collection of essays about a wide variety of topics. They are best for getting a bird's eye view of the work. I prefer books about specific management skill sets.
