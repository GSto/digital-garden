# Build Your Own Dropbox Fallacy

When Dropbox launched on Hackernews, one of the top comments was something to the effect of

> "why would anyone use dropbox when you can spin up rsync on an ftp?"

This fallacy, prevalent among engineers, shows an undervaluing of ease of use. It also does put value on the time needed to make and maintain a service. In fact, the opposite is true: its quite possible to build a company off of making a simple version of a complex process. examples include:

- [Shopify](https://shopify.com) - simple e-commerce
- [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com) - simple options trading
- [Mercury](https://mercury.com) - simple business banking
- [Wealthfront](https://wealthfront.com) - simple investing
- [Imgur](https://imgur.com) - simple file uploading
- [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) - simple cyypto onramp
- [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) - simple file syncing, obviously

This rhymes with, but is different than [[not invented here syndrome]]. Not invented here syndrome is about having a bias towards the build side of [[build vs buy]]. This fallacy is about undervaluing simplicity and customer experience.

note to self: is there a better term for this kind of thinking?
