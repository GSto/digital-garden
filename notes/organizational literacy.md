## Navigating Organizations
From Tom Critchlow's [Navigating Power & Status](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/)

- Every company has two org charts: the public one and the invisible one, created by status games people play.
- Draw several maps over days as your understanding evolves. Figure out who gets more stuff done. Figure out who, if anyone is sidelined.
- Look for who gets pulled into the room, that's the 1 sign of who has power and influence. 
- Types of roles
    - **Decision makers** - not always in the C-Suite. Sometimes subject matter experts can wield outsized amounts of power. Maybe that's one way you can work to seize more influence in an organization? 
    - **Gatekeepers** - Can be keepers of time or data. 
    - **Makers** - you wield power if you are the only person in the organization who can make something. For example, if you are the only person who can update the website. 
- Use the people who have the most power as examples of 'how to get things done' within an organization. 
- Also watch out for **power potholes** - people who have power in name, but not in practice. 
- consultants have no place on the map.
