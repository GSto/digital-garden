# Leverage

### The Six Types of Leverage

1. **Financial leverage** – Other people’s money so you’re not limited by your own net worth.
2. **Time leverage** – Other people’s time so you’re not limited to 24 hours in a day.
3. **Technology and Systems leverage** – Other people’s technology systems where you set up a scalable business model once and your systems can do the work thousands of times.
4. **Communications and Marketing leverage**– Access other people’s audiences through magazines, newsletters, radio shows, podcasts, and databases to communicate with millions of people.
5. **Network and Relationship leverage** – Expands your reach to include other people’s connections so you’re not limited to your own.
6. **Experience and Knowledge leverage** – Employs the expertise of others so you don’t have to learn everything yourself.
