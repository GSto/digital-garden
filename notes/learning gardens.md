# Learning Gardens

A structure for shared, [[squads]]-based [[independent research]] from [[other inter.net]], as outlined in their essays collection. 

Learning gardens should be low-stakes and experimental. 
## The assembly
Each week, a pair of researchers prepped a creative exploration of a topic that pertained to the mission. Typically a written entry, but other forms were allowed: video, audio, collage, software, etc. 

Break to digest, then a round of Q & A, where everyone gets an opportunity to ask a question of the contributors. This followed with an open-ended discussion, exploring the week's theme in-depth as well as potential for ongoing projects. 

## Interfaces 
* **Playing cards** - a collection of cards that show the available 'moves' of the research game, including "pollinate", "sprout", "branch", and "root."
* **Archive** - a database of past learning garden entries, tagged by date, topic, and researcher 
* **Reference Library** - collection of books, articles, essays, and academic papers that pertained to areas of research
* **Studio Kit** - A custom Notion interface that allowed researchers to maintain an internal blog (of sorts) and weave their personal ideas into a collective database of concepts. 
* **Prompt Bank** - A collection of open questions for researchers to write about, inspired by previous entires and discussions.
