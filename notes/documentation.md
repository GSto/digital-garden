# Documentation

## Writing Documentation Documents
Think about what you're writing and who it's for. Think about the [4 Types of Documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/)
- tutorials - learning oriented
- how-to guides - problem oriented 
- explanation - understanding oriented 
- reference - information oriented

## In project documentation

Adding documentation is a way you can add value when doing a [[code review]].

## External documentation
documentation can be used as a form of [[marketing]]. If you have a product that is developer facing, developers will want good documentation. It can be a deal breaker as to wether or not they use that product.

## Common problems
Everyone says they want more documentation, however few read it and fewer write it. Why is this the case? Typically documentation suffers from one side or the other of the [[capture vs retrieval]] problem.
