# Antifragility

- Antifragility is defined as anything that loves randomness or uncertainty. Systems and people that gain from disorder are considered antifragile. 
- There is a **fragility** triad containing three concepts: fragility, robustness (aka [[resiliency]]), and antifragility. 
- [[redundancy]] is a way to add both antifragility and [[resiliency]].
