# Tech Specs
Typically the points I try to hit are:

* Goal of the project
* How to measure impact / analytics
* Constraints
* What's out of scope
* Implementation details
* Types / API Contract
* Release strategy
* Open questions / discussion points


Every spec doesn't need every section, depends on the size and scope of the project.
