# Friendliness

"store excess food in each other's stomachs" - not everyone can succeed all the time. help others when its not your turn, get them on your side

## Reply Game

Think of replying to others as [[improv]], not debate. stick to "yes ands", refrain from "no buts"

- ask good questions - why "specific microinteraction?" (in gentle, non defensice way) ; "what is your relationship with X?"
- give sincere and specific compliments

## Friendly Criticism

good criticism requires [[vision]](a view on what's possible, how things could be better). criticism without vision can't be constructive, and is worse than useless
