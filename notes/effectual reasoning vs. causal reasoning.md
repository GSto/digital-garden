[[effectual reasoning]] is taking stock of where you are, and seeing where you can get to from there. **causal reasoning** is looking at where you want to go, and working backwards to connect the dots. 

An example from CommonCog's article, [when action beats prediction](https://commoncog.com/when-action-beats-prediction/)

If you use causal thinking, you’ll say something like “ok, we’re making carbonara tonight” and then you will work backwards from the end goal (carbonara for, say, five people) to checking for ingredients in your kitchen, to purchasing the ingredients you don’t have, to prepping and cooking carbonara for your dinner party.

If you use effectual thinking, you’ll say something like “ok, what ingredients and tools do I have _right now_, and what can I make tonight?” You work _forwards_ from existing resources; the end product is unknown.
