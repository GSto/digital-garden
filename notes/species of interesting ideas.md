# Species of Interesting Ideas

From Murray Davis's [That's Interesting](https://proseminarcrossnationalstudies.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/thatsinteresting_1971.pdf)

The opposite of attention is the 'taken for granted' zombie-like state that we spend a majority of our lives in. Interesting things create attention. You create interest by attacking this 'taken for granted' zone. 

You have to take your audience into account. You have to understand the assumptions your audience has so that you can attack them, subvert them, to be interesting.
