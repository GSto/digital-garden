# Variance 

Variance is the range between possible outcomes. Not to be confused with [[randomness]], [[uncertainty]], or [[risk]]. 

Choices with low variances should be made quickly. It's often not worth the time or effort to think too hard about decisions where there is little difference in the options, or if the choice is easily reversible. 

Decisions between options with high variance is easier that decisions with low variance. 

The greater the variance in uncertain or uncontrollable outcomes, the greater factor [[luck]] plays.
