# Open Pull Request Rule

## Description
When the user asks to open a pull request, automatically use the GitHub CLI (`gh pr create`) to open a pull request that follows best practices.

## Trigger
- When the user requests to open a pull request (e.g., "open a pull request", "create a PR", etc.)

## Actions
1. Ensure all changes are committed using the conventional commit format.
2. Use the GitHub CLI to open a pull request:
   - `gh pr create --fill --web`
   - Use the latest commit message(s) as the PR title and description.
   - Open the PR in the user's browser for review and completion.
3. Follow best practices for PRs:
   - Clear, descriptive title (from commit message)
   - Detailed description (from commit body or summary of changes)
   - Reference related issues if applicable
   - Assign reviewers if specified by the user
   - Set appropriate labels if specified by the user

## Example Command
```
gh pr create --fill --web
```

## Notes
- The rule assumes the user is authenticated with the GitHub CLI and has push access to the repository.
- The PR will be created from the current branch to the default branch unless otherwise specified by the user.
- The PR will be opened in the browser for any final edits or reviewer assignments.
